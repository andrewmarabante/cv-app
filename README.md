# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


In this project I learned the basics of react. In react, we render components separately. Each component holds it's own state values that you give it and you can pass these values to other components via props. The syntax for this was pretty fricken annoying but I'm starting to get the hang of it. That being said, The actual logic part of this project is done and I don't want to spend hours making it look pretty!
